I wrote this plugin because I was tired of having to fueling my own oven and
I needed to update somebody else's addon. I hope you find it useful since it might
help you find the type and name of items that exist in the game without having
to dump the entire DLL to get the classes. If there are issues, I am by no
means a C# programmer or expert. I am a lowly Cloud Architect and 
DevOps Engineer who likes to play with code.
